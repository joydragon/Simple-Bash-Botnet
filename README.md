# Simple-Bash-Botnet

This is a project to create a simple botnet in bash that can interact with Github Gists.

This is intended as an educational project that will be explained in an article in finsin.cl (soon)

To make it work, you'll need a Github personal token that can create and manipulate Gists (https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)

For the first time, you'll need to execute the manager.sh file to setup the private and public keys, then add the text of the public key to the bot file (sbb.sh).
